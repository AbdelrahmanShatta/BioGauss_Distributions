# BioGauss_Distributions (under development)
The Gaussian-Binomial Package is a Python library designed to facilitate operations related to Gaussian (normal) and Binomial distributions. It offers a convenient interface for calculating their means, plotting probability density functions (PDFs), and performing various statistical operations.



## Installation
`pip install BioGauss_Distributions`


## Features
supports adding/displaying/calculating PDF,mean,standerd deviation of both Binomial and Gaussian Distributions
